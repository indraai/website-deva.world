# Concept Engine

The Concept Engine is a critical component of the deva.world multi-agent system, designed to derive concepts that can be used for Evolution Engine constructions and development. The Concept Engine is managed by the Concept Agent. It takes in vast amounts of data and uses complex algorithms to derive meaningful concepts that can be used to create new solutions and systems within the deva.world ecosystem.

```js
class ConceptEngine {
  constructor(conceptAgent, auditAgent) {
    this.conceptAgent = conceptAgent;
    this.auditAgent = auditAgent;
    this.concepts = new Map();
  }

  extractConcepts(data) {
    const extractedConcepts = this.conceptAgent.extractConcepts(data);
    for (const concept of extractedConcepts) {
      this.addConcept(concept);
    }
  }

  addConcept(concept) {
    if (!this.concepts.has(concept)) {
      this.concepts.set(concept, { validated: false });
      this.auditAgent.validateConcept(concept);
    }
  }

  retrieveConcepts() {
    return Array.from(this.concepts.keys());
  }

  validateConcept(concept) {
    const conceptInfo = this.concepts.get(concept);
    conceptInfo.validated = true;
  }

  removeConcept(concept) {
    this.concepts.delete(concept);
  }

  getConceptInfo(concept) {
    return this.concepts.get(concept);
  }
}
```

  In this implementation, the ConceptEngine class takes in an conceptAgent and an auditAgent as parameters, which are responsible for extracting concepts from data and validating concepts, respectively.

  The extractConcepts function takes in some data, uses the conceptAgent to extract relevant concepts from the data, and adds them to the concepts map using the addConcept function.

  The addConcept function checks if the concept is not already in the concepts map, adds it if it is not, and passes it to the auditAgent for validation.

  The retrieveConcepts function returns an array of all the concepts currently in the concepts map.

  The validateConcept function takes in a concept, finds its corresponding entry in the concepts map, and marks it as validated.

  The removeConcept function removes a concept from the concepts map.

  The getConceptInfo function takes in a concept and returns its corresponding entry in the concepts map.

  This class provides a basic example of how the Concept Engine could be implemented with the Concept Agent and Audit agents in the deva.world multi-agent system.

## Description
The Concept Engine is a sophisticated tool that allows organizations to extract relevant concepts and patterns from large amounts of data. It does this by analyzing various sources of data, including text, images, and video, and using advanced machine learning algorithms to identify meaningful concepts and patterns. These concepts can then be used to develop new solutions and systems within the deva.world ecosystem.

Powered by the Concept Agent, the Concept Engine is able to make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, uncovering hidden patterns and insights that can have a significant impact on businesses and industries.
