# Evolution Engine

The Evolution Engine is a key component of the deva.world multi-agent system, designed to enable agents to continuously learn and evolve in response to changing environments and new data. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources, derive patterns and insights, and generate predictions and recommendations that help agents make more informed decisions.

```js
class EvolutionEngine {
  constructor(dataSources) {
    this.dataSources = dataSources;
    this.patterns = [];
    this.insights = [];
    this.predictions = [];
    this.recommendations = [];
  }

  analyzeData() {
    // Use advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources
    for (let i = 0; i < this.dataSources.length; i++) {
      // Analyze data from each source
      const data = this.dataSources[i];
      const pattern = this.analyzePattern(data);
      const insight = this.analyzeInsight(data);
      const prediction = this.generatePrediction(data);
      const recommendation = this.generateRecommendation(data);

      // Add results to corresponding arrays
      this.patterns.push(pattern);
      this.insights.push(insight);
      this.predictions.push(prediction);
      this.recommendations.push(recommendation);
    }
  }

  analyzePattern(data) {
    // Analyze patterns in the data
    const pattern = /* Machine learning algorithm to analyze patterns */;

    return pattern;
  }

  analyzeInsight(data) {
    // Analyze insights in the data
    const insight = /* Machine learning algorithm to analyze insights */;

    return insight;
  }

  generatePrediction(data) {
    // Generate predictions based on the data
    const prediction = /* Machine learning algorithm to generate predictions */;

    return prediction;
  }

  generateRecommendation(data) {
    // Generate recommendations based on the data
    const recommendation = /* Machine learning algorithm to generate recommendations */;

    return recommendation;
  }

  shareResults() {
    // Share results with other agents
    const collectiveIntelligence = {
      patterns: this.patterns,
      insights: this.insights,
      predictions: this.predictions,
      recommendations: this.recommendations
    };

    // Collaborate with other agents
    // ...
  }
}
```

> This class initializes with an array of data sources, and has methods to analyze the data, generate patterns, insights, predictions, and recommendations based on machine learning algorithms, and share the results with other agents. It also has properties to store the results in arrays.
