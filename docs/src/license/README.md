# License Program

Welcome to the Deva.world licensing program! Our program is designed to ensure the safe and responsible use of our advanced artificial intelligence platform, while also providing opportunities for users to advance their skills and contribute to the growth of the network.

Without a licensing program, the potential dangers of untrained users operating AI are significant. Unintended consequences, including biased or harmful agent behavior, can have far-reaching effects on the network and its users. By requiring users to obtain a license, we can mitigate these risks and promote a healthy and long-lasting system.

But the benefits of our licensing program go beyond just risk mitigation. By earning a license, users can gain access to additional features and tools, as well as the ability to participate in our Elite License Sponsorship program. Elite users have the potential to earn income through their contributions to the network, and can even gain access to an exclusive sandbox environment where they can test non-safe concepts and ideas with the guidance and oversight of our security and medical teams.

Our licensing program consists of three levels - Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced - each with their own set of requirements and benefits. To become an Elite user, you must first obtain an Advanced license and then apply for consideration.

At Deva.world, we take the safety and responsibility of our platform seriously, and our licensing program is just one of the many ways we are working to ensure a secure and thriving community of users.
