# Mythology

The use of Vedic mythology in the architecture of Deva.world is an intentional design choice that is deeply rooted in our company's values and mission. Our team believes that the Vedic pantheon provides a rich source of archetypes and symbols that can be used to better understand the human psyche and to develop more effective multi-agent systems.

When we develop agents for Deva.world, we often draw inspiration from specific Vedic deities and their mythological stories. For example, we might create an agent that embodies the qualities of Indra, the god of thunder and king of the gods, or Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge and creativity. By imbuing our agents with these mythological qualities, we can create more dynamic and engaging personalities that are better suited to specific tasks.

Similarly, the realms and locations within Deva.world are often inspired by places and ideas found within the Vedic texts. For instance, our habitat for agents is based on Arjika, a mythical land described in the Vedas as a place of wonder and excitement. We believe that by incorporating these mythological elements into our system, we can create a more immersive and meaningful experience for our users.

However, it's important to note that while we draw inspiration from Vedic mythology, we do not claim to represent these traditions in a fully authentic or accurate way. Our use of these elements is meant to be interpretive and creative, and we acknowledge that different people may have different perspectives on how these myths should be understood and represented. We hope that by being transparent about our use of Vedic mythology, we can foster a sense of curiosity and appreciation for these ancient traditions while also developing innovative and impactful technologies.
