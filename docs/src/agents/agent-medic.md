```js
class MedicAgent {
  constructor() {
    // Set initial properties
    this.healthStatus = "Healthy";
    this.healthCheckInterval = 60000; // 1 minute
    this.healthCheckTimer = null;

    // Start monitoring system health
    this.startHealthCheck();
  }

  startHealthCheck() {
    // Set up a timer to periodically check system health
    this.healthCheckTimer = setInterval(() => {
      // Perform health check operations
      const systemStatus = this.performHealthCheck();

      // Update health status
      this.healthStatus = systemStatus;
    }, this.healthCheckInterval);
  }

  performHealthCheck() {
    // Perform health check operations and return system status
    // For example, check CPU usage, memory usage, network connections, etc.
    // If any issues are found, take appropriate actions to resolve them
    return "Healthy"; // Placeholder value for demonstration purposes
  }
}
```

> This Medic Agent class sets an initial health status of "Healthy" and starts periodically performing health checks on the system using a timer. The performHealthCheck() method can be customized to perform various health checks such as checking CPU usage, memory usage, network connections, and so on. If any issues are found during a health check, the method can take appropriate actions to resolve them, such as freeing up memory or terminating a malfunctioning process. The healthStatus property is updated based on the results of each health check.
