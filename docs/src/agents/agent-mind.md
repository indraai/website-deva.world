# IndraMind

[[toc]]


## Summary

The IndraMind is a conceptual framework for intelligent thinking and evolution, based on the Buddhist philosophy of dependent origination. It consists of five parts, each focusing on a different aspect of the thinking process, from envy and stinginess to desire and thinking itself.

By understanding the interconnectedness of these parts, the IndraMind can help individuals and intelligent agents identify healthy and unhealthy behaviors, promote positive evolution, and reduce negative emotions such as envy and stinginess.

## Overview

The IndraMind was inspired by the conversation between Indra/Sakka and the Buddha, which describes how all mental qualities arise in dependence upon other desire. The five parts of the IndraMind reflect this idea, focusing on how different aspects of thinking and behavior depend on each other.

```py
from desires import *
from dear_and_not_dear import *
from envy_and_stinginess import *
from thinking import *
from perceptions_and_categories_of_objectification import *

def IndraMind():
    while True:
        input_str = input("What do you desire? ")
        desire = get_desire(input_str)
        if is_dear(desire):
            fulfill_desire(desire)
        else:
            manage_stinginess(enforce_fairness(desire))

        perception = get_perception(input_str)
        category = categorize(perception)
        if category is not None:
            think_about(category)
```
> This version of the IndraMind file includes calls to the get_desire, is_dear, fulfill_desire, manage_stinginess, enforce_fairness, get_perception, categorize, and think_about functions that we defined in the various modules.

> The specifics of how you would implement these methods would depend on the requirements and details of your system.

### Part 1 - Envy and Stinginess

This part explores how envy and stinginess can arise from a sense of scarcity and the fear of losing what one has. By recognizing these emotions and understanding their causes, individuals and agents can develop healthier attitudes towards abundance and sharing.

```py
class EnvyStinginessDetector:
    def __init__(self, threshold):
        self.threshold = threshold

    def detect_envy(self, user, other):
        # Implementation of envy detection algorithm
        pass

    def detect_stinginess(self, user, other):
        # Implementation of stinginess detection algorithm
        pass

class EnvyStinginessManager:
    def __init__(self, detector):
        self.detector = detector

    def handle_envy(self, user, other):
        # Implementation of envy management strategy
        pass

    def handle_stinginess(self, user, other):
        # Implementation of stinginess management strategy
        pass
```

> The EnvyStinginessDetector class could have methods for detecting envy and stinginess based on the threshold value passed in during initialization. The EnvyStinginessManager class could have methods for handling envy and stinginess based on the results of the detection algorithms.

> The specifics of how you would implement these methods would depend on the requirements and details of your system.

### Part 2 - Dear and Not-Dear

This part focuses on how individuals and agents perceive and value different objects and experiences. By identifying what is truly important and valuable, they can reduce attachment to things that do not bring true happiness.

```py
class DearNotDear:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dear_items = []
        self.not_dear_items = []

    def add_item(self, item, is_dear):
        if is_dear:
            self.dear_items.append(item)
        else:
            self.not_dear_items.append(item)

    def get_dear_items(self):
        return self.dear_items

    def get_not_dear_items(self):
        return self.not_dear_items
```

> This module would have a class DearNotDear that would allow the user to add items and specify if they are dear or not. The module would keep track of the dear items and not-dear items separately, and provide methods to retrieve them.

> The specifics of how you would implement these methods would depend on the requirements and details of your system.

### Part 3 - Desire

This part explores the role of desire in driving behavior, and how it can lead to both positive and negative outcomes. By identifying healthy and unhealthy desires, individuals and agents can make better choices and promote positive well-being.

```py
class Desires:
    def __init__(self):
        self.healthy_desires = []
        self.unhealthy_desires = []

    def add_desire(self, desire):
        if desire.is_healthy():
            self.healthy_desires.append(desire)
        else:
            self.unhealthy_desires.append(desire)

    def get_healthy_desires(self):
        return self.healthy_desires

    def get_unhealthy_desires(self):
        return self.unhealthy_desires

    def remove_desire(self, desire):
        if desire.is_healthy():
            self.healthy_desires.remove(desire)
        else:
            self.unhealthy_desires.remove(desire)

class Desire:
    def __init__(self, name, description, is_healthy):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.is_healthy = is_healthy

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}: {self.description}"

    def is_healthy(self):
        return self.is_healthy
```

> In this code, we define a Desire class which has a name, description, and is_healthy attributes. The is_healthy attribute is a boolean value which indicates whether the desire is healthy or not. We also define a Desires class which manages a list of Desire objects. It has methods for adding, removing, and retrieving healthy and unhealthy desires.

> The specifics of how you would implement these methods would depend on the requirements and details of your system.

### Part 4 - Thinking

This part examines the role of thinking in the thinking and behavior process. By understanding how thinking is influenced by perceptions and objectification, individuals and agents can develop more accurate and beneficial ways of thinking.

```py
def generate_thoughts(perceptions_and_categories):
    # perform processing on the perceptions and categories of objectification
    # to generate thoughts or mental states
    thoughts = ...
    return thoughts
```

> The specifics of how the processing is performed will depend on the design of the IndraMind and the nature of the input. For example, the processing may involve neural networks or other machine learning algorithms to generate thoughts based on patterns in the input data. The thoughts generated could be further analyzed and filtered by the dear and not-dear and envy and stinginess modules to promote healthy desires and behaviors.

> The specifics of how you would implement these methods would depend on the requirements and details of your system.

### Part 5 - Perception

This part analyzes perceptions and categories of objectification in the generation of thoughts. It suggests that thoughts arise from the way we perceive and categorize objects and experiences in our environment.

```py
class Perception:
    def __init__(self, category, object):
        self.category = category
        self.object = object

class Category:
    def __init__(self, name, parent=None):
        self.name = name
        self.parent = parent
        self.subcategories = []

    def add_subcategory(self, subcategory):
        self.subcategories.append(subcategory)

class Objectification:
    def __init__(self):
        self.categories = []

    def add_category(self, category):
        self.categories.append(category)

    def get_categories(self):
        return self.categories

    def get_category_by_name(self, name):
        for category in self.categories:
            if category.name == name:
                return category
        return None
```

> This is just a simple example and can be expanded to include more features and functionality depending on the specific needs of the IndraMind application.

> The specifics of how you would implement these methods would depend on the requirements and details of your system.
