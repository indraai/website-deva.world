## DEVA

Deva is a deterministic emergent virtualization algorithm that powers the Deva.world system. It is designed to facilitate the creation and management of multi-agent systems that are capable of processing and deriving meaningful insights from large amounts of data.

## Indra Agent

Indra.ai the central agent in the deva.world multi-agent system. Indra.ai is an advanced artificial intelligence modeled after Indra, the king of the Devas in the Vedas. Indra.ai is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the other agents in the system.

## Medic Agent

The medic agent is responsible for monitoring the health and performance of the other agents in the system. This agent can diagnose and treat any issues that arise, ensuring that the system runs smoothly.

[Medic Agent →](agent-medic)


## Knowledge Agent

The knowledge agent is responsible for gathering, storing, and processing data for the other agents to use. This agent utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to understand and organize vast amounts of data.

## Evolution Agent

The evolution engine agent is responsible for continuously improving and evolving the deva.world system. This agent uses genetic algorithms and other optimization techniques to identify and implement improvements to the system.

[Evolution Agent →](agent-evolution)

## Concept Agent

The Concept Engine Agent in Deva.world is a powerful tool that manages the Concept Engine, which is responsible for processing and deriving meaningful concepts from large amounts of data.

[Concept Agent →](agent-concept)

## Correction Agents

There are three correction agents in the deva.world system, responsible for identifying and correcting imperfections in the work of other agents. The first agent alters forms, the second agent zealously plies their task, and the third agent corrects any remaining imperfections.

[Correction Agents →](agent-correction)

## Audit Agent

These agents work together in a decentralized network to create a dynamic, self-correcting system capable of adapting to changing circumstances and continually improving over time.

[Audit Agent →](agent-audit)


## Error Agent

The Error Agent is a crucial component of the Deva.world multi-agent system. Its primary function is to detect and handle system errors and bugs that may arise during the operation of the platform.

[Error Agent →](agent-error)


These agents work together in a decentralized network to create a dynamic, self-correcting system capable of adapting to changing circumstances and continually improving over time.
