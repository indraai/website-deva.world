# Audit Agent

## Overview

The Audit Agent is a crucial component of the Deva.world multi-agent system, responsible for ensuring transparency and accountability in the system's decision-making processes. This agent monitors the actions and decisions made by other agents in the system, ensuring that they adhere to the rules and regulations set forth by the institutor. The Audit Agent is designed to be highly efficient and reliable, able to quickly detect and report any anomalies or deviations from the expected behavior.

```js
class AuditAgent {
  constructor() {
    this.experts = [];
    this.reputationScores = {};
  }

  verifyContent(content, creator) {
    let oppositionSpeech = this.calculateOppositionSpeech(content);
    if (oppositionSpeech > 0.5) {
      return this.forwardToExperts(content, creator);
    } else {
      return "Content is true and honest.";
    }
  }

  calculateOppositionSpeech(content) {
    // Your code to calculate opposition speech goes here
  }

  forwardToExperts(content, creator) {
    // Your code to forward content to experts goes here
  }

  applyReputationScore(content, creator, score) {
    // Your code to apply reputation score goes here
  }
}
```

> This sample class contains methods to verify content, calculate opposition speech, forward content to experts, and apply reputation scores. The verifyContent method checks the opposition speech of the content and decides whether to forward it to experts for verification. The calculateOppositionSpeech method calculates the amount of oppositional speech in the content. The forwardToExperts method forwards the content to a list of experts for verification. Finally, the applyReputationScore method applies a reputation score to the content and its creator.

> This is just a sample class, and you can customize it to fit your specific needs in the deva.world system.
