# First Protocol

First Protocol: Truth Identification and Data Integrity

## Summary

The first protocol of the deva.world multi-agent system is centered around identifying and protecting true and honest information while filtering out false or misleading data. This protocol is based on the Vedic principle that "that which is true and honest is protected, and that which is false is brought to nothing."

## Description

To implement this protocol, deva.world utilizes an audit agent that monitors data inputs for oppositional speech, which can indicate the presence of false information. If the oppositional speech threshold is reached, the audit agent forwards the information to classified experts for validation. Once the information is validated, it is given a reputation score that all agents in the system can rely on and trust.

## Benefits

By implementing this protocol, deva.world ensures the integrity of the data used by all agents in the system. This prevents the propagation of false information and improves the accuracy of interactions between humans and intelligent agents. Additionally, this protocol provides a public source learning repository that can be used for research, education, and knowledge sharing.

## Features
- Audit agent for monitoring data inputs
- Oppositional speech threshold for filtering false information
- Collaboration with classified experts, angets, and elite license holders for data validation
- Reputation score for trusted data
- Public source learning repository for research, education, and knowledge sharing

## Conclusion

The first protocol of the deva.world multi-agent system ensures the integrity of data used by all agents in the system. By protecting true and honest information while filtering out false or misleading data, deva.world promotes more accurate interactions between humans and intelligent agents.
