# Deva Agent

Deterministic Emergent Virtualization Algorithm

## Summary

Deva is a deterministic emergent virtualization algorithm that powers the Deva.world system. It is designed to facilitate the creation and management of multi-agent systems that are capable of processing and deriving meaningful insights from large amounts of data. Deva is a powerful tool that enables agents to make more informed decisions and adapt to changing environments, ultimately leading to better outcomes for users.

The Deva algorithm is composed of several components. These components work in tandem to facilitate the creation, evolution, and management of agents within the Deva.world system.

Deva is designed to enable the creation and management of complex multi-agent systems that are capable of processing and deriving meaningful insights from large amounts of data. It is composed of several components that work together to facilitate the creation, evolution, and management of agents within the system.

```js
class DevaAgent {
  constructor() {
    this.highLevelGoals = [];
    this.virtualCommunities = [];
  }

  setHighLevelGoals(goals) {
    // check if user is authorized to set goals
    // set high level goals
  }

  addVirtualCommunity(community) {
    // check if user is authorized to add a community
    // add virtual community to list
  }

  mutateSubGoals(communityIndex, subGoals) {
    // check if user is authorized to mutate sub-goals for this community
    // mutate sub-goals for the specified community
  }
}
```

> This implementation assumes that the Simulator Agent takes a resourceType parameter to specify whether it is using a MAS Simulation tool or a clone of the live Cyber Habitat. It has a method for producing a simulation (produceSimulation) that handles the specifics of invoking the simulation tool or cloning the live Habitat.

> The specifics of how you would implement these methods would depend on the requirements and details of your system.
