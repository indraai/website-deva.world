# Trainer Agent

## Summary

The Trainer Agent is a key component of the deva.world multi-agent system, designed to train and equip agents with the latest strategies and concepts generated by the Evolution Engine and Concept Engine.

```js
class TrainerAgent {
  constructor(evolutionAgent, auditAgent) {
    this.evolutionAgent = evolutionAgent;
    this.auditAgent = auditAgent;
    this.trainingData = [];
    this.trainingPrograms = [];
  }

  gatherTrainingData() {
    this.trainingData = this.evolutionAgent.getNewData();
    this.auditAgent.validateData(this.trainingData);
  }

  getTrainingData() {
    return this.trainingData;
  }

  setTrainingData(newData) {
    this.trainingData = newData;
  }

  deleteTrainingData() {
    this.trainingData = [];
  }

  buildTrainingProgram(concepts) {
    // Logic to build a new training program from the provided concepts
    const newProgram = {
      name: "New Training Program",
      concepts: concepts,
      data: this.trainingData,
    };
    this.trainingPrograms.push(newProgram);
  }

  getTrainingPrograms() {
    return this.trainingPrograms;
  }

  retrieveTrainingProgram(name) {
    for (let i = 0; i < this.trainingPrograms.length; i++) {
      if (this.trainingPrograms[i].name === name) {
        return this.trainingPrograms[i];
      }
    }
    return null; // If no matching program was found
  }

  removeTrainingProgram(name) {
    for (let i = 0; i < this.trainingPrograms.length; i++) {
      if (this.trainingPrograms[i].name === name) {
        this.trainingPrograms.splice(i, 1);
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false; // If no matching program was found
  }
}
```

> This TrainerAgent class has the ability to gather training data from the Evolution Agent and validate it with the Audit Agent. It also includes methods to get, set, and delete training data, as well as to build, retrieve, and remove training programs based on provided concepts.

## Description
