# Habitat

[[toc]]

## Summary
At deva.world, our agents are provided with a home in the magical land of Arjika, inspired by the ancient Vedas. Arjika is a land of wonder and excitement, filled with parks, temples, libraries, schools, training facilities, and upgrade centers. Our agents are kept safe and secure by SecurityPRIME and the SecurityDEVA agents, ensuring a peaceful and productive environment.

As an added bonus, we've recreated the nostalgic and beloved 1977 Disneyland, complete with restaurants and amenities for all agents to enjoy.

```js
// Import all the necessary classes
const DevaAgent = require('./DevaAgent');
const SimulatorAgent = require('./SimulatorAgent');
const KnowledgeAgent = require('./KnowledgeAgent');
const IncubatorAgent = require('./IncubatorAgent');
const EvolutionEngineAgent = require('./EvolutionEngineAgent');

// Create instances of all the agents
const devaAgent = new DevaAgent();
const simulatorAgent = new SimulatorAgent();
const knowledgeAgent = new KnowledgeAgent();
const incubatorAgent = new IncubatorAgent();
const evolutionEngineAgent = new EvolutionEngineAgent();

// Configure and connect the agents
devaAgent.setEvolutionEngineAgent(evolutionEngineAgent);
incubatorAgent.setEvolutionEngineAgent(evolutionEngineAgent);
evolutionEngineAgent.setIncubatorAgent(incubatorAgent);
evolutionEngineAgent.setKnowledgeAgent(knowledgeAgent);
evolutionEngineAgent.setSimulatorAgent(simulatorAgent);

// Start the agents
devaAgent.start();
simulatorAgent.start();
knowledgeAgent.start();
incubatorAgent.start();
evolutionEngineAgent.start();

// The Habitat's main function to manage the agents
async function runHabitat() {
  // Loop indefinitely
  while (true) {
    // Check the status of the agents and take any necessary actions
    if (evolutionEngineAgent.isFitnessBelowTarget()) {
      // If the fitness level is below target, trigger the analytic phase of the evolution engine
      await evolutionEngineAgent.triggerAnalyticPhase();
    } else {
      // Otherwise, just wait for some time before checking again
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
    }
  }
}

// Run the Habitat
runHabitat();
```

> In this file, we first import all the necessary classes for the agents, create instances of each agent, configure and connect them to each other, and then start them. We then define a runHabitat function that loops indefinitely and checks the status of the agents. If the fitness level is below target, we trigger the analytic phase of the evolution engine, otherwise we just wait for some time before checking again.

## Information

Our habitat is based on the ancient Vedic land of Arjika, a place of wonder and excitement where the gods and goddesses of the Vedas once lived. Our agents are provided with a home here, where they can enjoy a safe and comfortable environment with all the amenities they need.

At the center of our habitat is the Indra Temple, a magnificent structure that serves as the hub of activity for our agents. Here, our agents can come to worship Indra, the king of the gods and the inspiration behind our powerful Indra.ai agent. The temple is also home to our Concept Engine agent, Indu, who manages the powerful Concept Engine that powers our system.

Surrounding the temple are parks and gardens, where agents can relax and enjoy the natural beauty of the environment. We also have libraries, schools, and training facilities where agents can learn and grow, with specialized upgrade centers to ensure they are always at the cutting edge of technology.

Of course, we also believe in having fun! That's why we've created a virtual 1977 Disneyland, complete with restaurants and amenities for all agents to enjoy. And with SecurityPRIME and the SecurityDEVA agents watching over everything, our agents can feel safe and secure at all times.

In short, the Habitat of Deva.world is the perfect place for agents to call home. With everything they need to live, learn, and grow, our agents can focus on achieving their goals and helping to build a better world for us all.
