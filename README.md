# deva.world

## Summary

Deva.world is a multi-agent system designed to facilitate the creation and evolution of intelligent agents that can perform a wide range of tasks. The system consists of several components, including the Concept Engine, Evolution Engine, Audit Agent, Correction Agents, and Error Agent, that work together to ensure that agents are constantly learning, adapting, and improving their performance.

## Overview

Deva.world is a distributed system that allows agents to interact with each other and with external systems in order to accomplish complex tasks. The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing it to adapt to changing requirements and environments.

The system consists of several key components, including:

- Concept Engine Agent: This agent is responsible for processing and deriving meaningful concepts from large amounts of data. It works in tandem with the Evolution Engine Agent to facilitate the creation and evolution of new agents within the system.

- Evolution Engine Agent: This agent is responsible for creating and evolving new agents based on the concepts derived by the Concept Engine Agent. It uses a genetic algorithm to create and refine new agents over time.

- Audit Agent: This agent is responsible for monitoring the performance of agents within the system and identifying areas for improvement.

- Correction Agents: There are three correction agents within the system that work to correct errors and imperfections in the agents created by the Evolution Engine Agent.

- Error Agent: This agent is responsible for identifying and correcting errors in the system itself.

## Description

Deva.world is a complex system designed to create and evolve intelligent agents that can perform a wide range of tasks. The system is built around the concept of a multi-agent system, which allows agents to interact with each other and with external systems in order to accomplish complex tasks.

The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing it to adapt to changing requirements and environments. The Concept Engine Agent is responsible for deriving meaningful concepts from large amounts of data, while the Evolution Engine Agent is responsible for creating and refining agents based on those concepts.

The Audit Agent monitors the performance of agents within the system, identifying areas for improvement and making recommendations for changes. The Correction Agents work to correct errors and imperfections in the agents created by the Evolution Engine Agent, while the Error Agent is responsible for identifying and correcting errors in the system itself.
